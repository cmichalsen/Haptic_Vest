# Haptic Vest
Designed to work with games that support BHaptics using their available websocket interface on localhost port 15881. 
This project was inspired by https://github.com/bhaptics/tact-python. More information on BHaptics interface can be 
found at https://github.com/bhaptics/haptic-library. I am initially focusing on the front vest for 
development simplicity. Many of the parts chosen were what I had on hand. I expect these to change later on.

I decided to start this project because I did not see many DIY solutions online. I also thought this would be a great 
opportunity to meet and work with others. Please feel free to join in on this.

## Progress
* Receiving haptic data from Zero Caliber and Phasmophobia
* *Game_Server.py* communicates with Haptic vest microcontroller
* Haptic vest microcontroller is able to vary power to each motor
* Shots in Zero Caliber seem to work relatively well

## Known Issues
* *Game_Server.py* sometimes reports several errors for missing end frames in data received from games
* Channels D3 and D4 PWM outputs are lower than other channels due to the higher resistors 
    * Consider using other GPIO channels or PWM drivers instead of transistors
* I don't believe I am using the provided timing attributes correctly for delays. Need to review BHaptic's SDK.
* The ESP8266 ESP-12E does not have enough GPIO to support 9 motors on front and back vests (18 total). 
    * Need to research other options such as ESP32.
* It is not obvious when the microcontroller is connected to WiFi and/or the game server. 
    * Plan to add a couple of status LEDs
